#  A Decentralized Internet Service Provider
#  Problem:
Internrt Service providers in Nigeria are unaccountable when it comes to allocating data to indivduals. there is no transparent system to monitor how much data is being consumed and the rate. Customers(users) should be able to monitor their bandwith.

# Solution:
A decentralised system where traditional internet providers(data centers) allocate bandwith to individuals per pay. The system brings the open market and interoperable peering from the data center to the field and empowering individuals to have networks faster and more affordable than legacy telecom models. The system allocates highspeed broadband to the endusers based on how much internet was purchased by the end user using ether. The end user can monitor how much internet is left on their network. 

# Questions
1. Database needed?
Yes a database is needed to store information of all the available users and to monitor the bandwith
2. are there multiple writers?
Yes there are multiple writers on the system(the end users).
3. can a 3rd party be trusted?
No, a third party cannot be trusted with the personal infomation.
4. access control is not needed.
5. Pubilc blockchain?
yes transactions have to be monitored in this data purchased.

# Workflow
1. a user registers on the platform and a wallet is generated for the user.
2. a user is able to fund his wallet.
4. a users is able to purchse data with ether and a certain amount of bandwith is allocated to the user
5. a user can check his balance to know how much bandwith is left.
